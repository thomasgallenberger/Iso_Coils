# Iso_Coils
Plot the coils for an isodynamic stellarator
To get the .sldcrv files into solidworks use insert -> curves -> curve through xyz points
A menu will pop up, click browse and select the file you want 

If you try to plot these coils with python it is important to note that the files are xzy because the y axis is the vertical axis in solidworks.
